This is the code used for my project in Arduino for the class "Human-computer Interaction" in the 2015/2016 year at the University of Warsaw, Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics.

Included is the code for the Android app used to control the Arduino from the phone. It allows the user to connect to the Arduino and set the RGB color for the LED. It then turns the LED on or off based on whether there are any notifications on the phone. 

Utilized tools include the BluetoothAdapter interface and the NotificationListenerService class. 

This is also the first Android app I've built.
